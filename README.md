# About 
This was a school project designed to use the [Constellation](http://www.myconstellation.io/) plateform.  
`MediaPlayer`, `RemoteControl` and `RemoteWebcam` are the 3 packages designed to run on a Constellation server. The first package is a stand alone media player remotely controlled. The second package contains a lot of features to control your computer settings. The later gives the possibility to remotely take photos with your computer webcam.  
`RemoteApp` is the web application to control the computer running the server. This is an android application built with the ionic framework, and can be run on a desktop browser too.
